    "text": "With the NCAA basketball season wrapped up, there are many trends and wild statistics to look at to tell a story about how and why a team’s season ended the way it ended. One team, in particular, had great success throughout the regular season, but come March, when it mattered most, they couldn’t find any.\nThe St. John’s Red Storm won both the Big East regular season and tournament titles. That’s right, in just his second season as head coach, Rick Pitino conquered the Big East. With 30 wins and just four losses headed into the NCAA tournament, you would expect the Red Storm to be a team to look out for.\nBut, why though? Sure, they had 31 wins, by just looking at very basic stats, St. John’s was a very subpar free throw shooting team, which, down the stretch in games, makes a huge difference in the outcome.\nTheir four losses prior to the NCAA tournament came by a combined seven points, yes, only seven points. What could their season outcome have been if they were good, or at least average, at the charity stripe?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nncaamen &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaateamdata.csv\")\n\nstj &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"St. John's (NY)\")\nfla &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"Florida\")\nwis &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"Wisconsin\")\napb &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"Arkansas-Pine Bluff\")\nuh &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"Houston\") \nduke &lt;- ncaamen |&gt; filter(School == \"Duke\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=ncaamen, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=stj, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=fla, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=wis, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=apb, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=uh, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=duke, aes(x=W, y=FTPer * 100), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 17.26923) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.7197198 * 100) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=27, y=83.50, label=\"Wisconsin\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=36, y=71.3, label=\"Florida\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=35, y=80.85, label=\"Duke\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=35, y=75.77, label=\"Houston\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=31, y=68.40, label=\"St. John's\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6, y=60, label=\"Arkansas-Pine Bluff\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=28, y=62, label=\"High win total, low free throw %\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=9.55, y=84, label=\"Low win total, high free throw %\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins\", \n    y=\"Free Throw Percentage\", \n    title=\"St. John's achieved the 30+win mark despite being well \\nbelow average from the free throw line\", \n    subtitle=\"The Red Storm's four regular season losses were by a combined seven points, better free throw shooting \\ncould have boosted their win total even more.\", \n    caption=\"Source: SportsReference | By Jacob Saelens\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely, those free throw numbers aren’t what got them a 2-seed. Afterall, Rick Pitino’s teams have always been defensive-minded. This is where St. John’s excelled all season long. In fact, their numbers compared to the other top-seeded teams were the best. The defense capitalized on their forced turnovers, and the offense, even with their shooting woes, didn’t turn the ball over all that much. By looking at a comparison of those stats, one may assume the Red Storm were one of the best teams in the NCAA this season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\nncaamen &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaateamdata.csv\")\n\nncaamennew &lt;-ncaamen |&gt;\n  mutate(GoodTO = STL + BLK)\n\ntopthree &lt;- c(\"Florida\", \"Duke\", \"Houston\", \"Auburn\", \"Michigan State\", \"St. John's (NY)\", \"Alabama\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Iowa State\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Kentucky\")\n\nonetwothree &lt;- ncaamennew |&gt; \n  filter(School %in% topthree)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=onetwothree, \n    aes(y=reorder(School, GoodTO), x=GoodTO, xend=TOV),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=320, y=7.5, label=\"Green on the left is bad\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=320, y=8.8, label=\"Green on the right is good\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Turnovers vs. Blocks & Steals\", \n    y=\"Team\", \n    title=\"St. John's stuffed the stat sheet with steals and \\nblocks all season long\", \n    subtitle=\"The Red Storm were among the best of the best in making life hard for offenses, propelling \\nthem to a very high seeding.\", \n    caption=\"Source: SportsReference | By Jacob Saelens\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, the final result of the Red Storm’s season was not a good one, as they were eliminated by John Calipari’s Arkansas Razorbacks in the round of 32. St. John’s wasn’t just poor from the free throw line, they were flat-out terrible from beyond the arc. Pitino’s squad went 2 for 22 from three-point land in this game, which was ultimately a key factor in why their season came to an end earlier than what they had hoped.\nHowever, this performance was not just a “bad shooting day,” this performance capped off a “bad shooting year.” By once again comparing St. John’s three point percentage to the other top seeded teams this year, their rank is unsurprising, to say the least.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nbballdata &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaateamdata.csv\")\n\n\ntopthree &lt;- c(\"Florida\", \"Duke\", \"Houston\", \"Auburn\", \"Michigan State\", \"St. John's (NY)\", \"Alabama\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas Tech\", \"Iowa State\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Kentucky\")\n\nonetwothree &lt;- bballdata |&gt; \n  filter(School %in% topthree) |&gt;\n  select(School, ThreePPer) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(ThreePPer))\n\ntopseeds &lt;- onetwothree |&gt;\n  mutate(ThreePointPercentage = (ThreePPer)* 100\n  )\n\njohnnies &lt;- topseeds |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"St. John's (NY)\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=topseeds, aes(x=reorder(School, ThreePointPercentage), weight=ThreePointPercentage), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=johnnies, aes(x=reorder(School, ThreePointPercentage), weight=ThreePointPercentage), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"The Red Storm failed to get red hot, especially from \\ndeep\", \n    subtitle=\"The three-point struggles that St. John's faced played a role in them being one of just three \\ntop-three seeded teams eliminated before the sweet sixteen.\", \n    caption=\"Source: SportsReference | By Jacob Saelens\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stellar defense can only get you so far. In a game where that typical “stellar” defense doesn’t show up, the question is whether or not the offense can hold its own. Both Houston and St. John’s were often regarded as having the best defenses in the country. The difference is clear, out of the top seeded teams, the Cougars had the best three point percentage, whereas the Red Storm had the worst. This further proves that St. John’s early departure from the tournament shouldn’t be a surprise.\nCoach Pitino has made it very known that he will shy away from recruiting high school players, but instead utilize the transfer portal for as long as he stays with the Red Storm. It is clear and obvious what went wrong for them this season so it will be interesting to see the statistics of the players he brings in for the coming years. Will they be better at free throw shooting or from beyond the arc? If so, St. John’s can continue to be a team to look out for coming late march, and maybe even early April for the later rounds of the NCAA tournament."

    "section": "",
    "text": "First of all, I want to give a big thanks to Will Courchene, the co-founder of Data Golf, for providing me with excellent Masters data to utilize in this post!\nGolf fans around the world were filled with joy a few weeks ago on April 14th, as Rory McIlroy took home his first green jacket and completed the career grand slam as he won the 2025 Masters tournament at Augusta National Golf Course. This feat was a long time coming for McIlroy, who, in his 11th attempt, completed the career-long achievement of winning all four major championships. With the win, he becomes just the sixth player to join the career grand slam club, and the first to join since Tiger Woods in 2000.\nRory, throughout his career, has been able to win events and win them often. But, for 16 years in a row, he was unable to get the job done at the Masters. In his first 16 trips to Augusta, he had nine top 20 finishes, seven of those being in the top ten, four of those being in the top 5, and one runner-up finish in 2022. McIlroy has only missed the cut at the event three times, with two of those coming this decade in 2021 and 2023. It felt like if Rory was going to get it done, it had to be sooner rather than later before his championship window closed.\nAfter shooting a 73 on Sunday with many ups and downs throughout the day, McIlroy found himself all knotted up with England’s Justin Rose at 11-under par, the two would head to a playoff, where McIlroy’s beautiful approach to just a couple feet helped him get a birdie, which won him the championship following Rose’s par.\nLike previously mentioned, McIlroy and Rose were tied after 72 holes. However, their paths to 11-under par were vastly different. Rose had many birdies and many bogeys, and was free of suffering anything worse. On the other hand, McIlroy suffered four double bogeys, but made up for them, at least a little bit, with three eagles throughout the tournament.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\n\n\nrorywin &lt;- read_csv(\"2025masters.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 212 Columns: 35\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (5): tour, event_name, player_name, fin_text, course_name\ndbl  (28): year, season, event_id, dg_id, round_num, course_num, course_par,...\ndate  (1): event_completed\ntime  (1): teetime\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nwafflechart &lt;- rorywin |&gt;\n  group_by (player_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    birdie = sum(birdies),\n    eagle = sum(eagles_or_better),\n    bogey = sum(bogies),\n    double = sum (doubles_or_worse),\n    par = sum(pars))\n\n\n\n\nrory &lt;- c(\"Double Bogey\"=4, \"Bogey\"=5, \"Par\"=42, \"Birdie\"=18, \"Eagle\"=3)\nrose &lt;- c(\"Bogey\"=13, \"Par\"=35, \"Birdie\"=24)\n\niron(\n  waffle(rory,\n         rows = 4,\n         colors = c(\"#8B0000\", \"#FF474C\", \"black\", \"#A1FA88\", \"#426F36\")) +\n    labs(\n      x= \"Rory McIlroy\",\n      title = \"Rory McIlroy vs Justin Rose: Scoring at the 2025 Masters\",\n      subtitle = \"Through 72 holes, the two men had the same score, however, their paths to get there were \\nextremely different.\") +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.y = element_blank()\n    \n    ),\n  waffle(rose,\n         rows = 4,\n         colors = c(\"#FF474C\", \"black\", \"#A1FA88\")) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Justin Rose\\n1 square = 1 hole\",\n      caption = \"Source: Data Golf | By Jacob Saelens\"\n    )\n)"
